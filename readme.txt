== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =

If you are using the Subscribe2 plugin and want to increase the number of subscribers to your blog and are frustrated with the lack of options and reliability of the standard Subscribe2 Widget then this plugin is for you. Subscribe2 Widget Pro can be placed in any widgetized sidebar to display a subscription form that you can then customize and style to your hearts delight!

= I'm not receiving any emails, what's the deal? =

First, please ensure that your WordPress is sending emails correctly by using [Check Email](http://wordpress.org/plugins/check-email/ "Check Email") or [WP SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smtp/ "WP SMTP") to test email functionality. If you do not receive emails after testing with either of these plugins then something is wrong with either your WordPress or server email configuration.

= The plugin looks funny in my sidebar, what's the deal? =

Some themes may have very small sidebars and/or CSS styles that alter the appearance of Subscribe2 Widget Pro. Typically, this is easily fixed with a few CSS modifications. The WordImpress is not available to support theme conflicts for the free version of the plugin.
